# Credit_card_fraud_detection

This is the credit card fraud detection project which I have build using Logistic Regression.I have used google colaboratory which is way more convenient to work upon.

The steps for model building are - 

* Step1 - Import the libraries to be used in it.
* Step2 - Import the dataset.
* Step3 - Taking care of missing data.
* Step4 - Splitting the dataset into the training set and test set(80:20)
* Step5 - Training the Logistic Regression model on the training set
* Step6 - Model evaluation, checking accuracy on training data
* Step7 - Predicting the test set results
* Step8 - Checking accuracy on test set

Note: In this case, the dataset was highly imbalanced, so, I have used under-sampling technique, a technique to balance uneven datasets by keeping all of the data in the minority class and decreasing the size of the majority class.
-In the case of missing data one can use imputation, this method replaces the missing data by the average of the data.
